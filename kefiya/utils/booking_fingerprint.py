"""What makes two rows the same booking — and what only looks different.

The import decides "have I seen this before" by hashing five fields. Two
things were wrong with that hash, and both were measured on live data.

**It said different where the bank meant the same.** A bank hands the same
booking over in two formats, and this app reads both: MT940 through
old_kefiya_import, CAMT through kefiya_import. The old hash used

    date, amount, applicant_name, posting_text, purpose

and three of those five come out differently depending on the route:

    posting_text     MT940 'posting_text' against CAMT
                     'AdditionalEntryInformation'. Different fields, often
                     different words for one booking.
    applicant_name   wrapped at a fixed width in MT940, so the live data has
                     "Alexander und Christina Fin keissen" next to
                     "Dr. Alexander Finkeissen und Christina Finkeissen".
    purpose          wrapped the same way -- "Datum 28.02.20 26" is one date
                     with a line break in the middle of the year.

So one booking fetched by both routes produced two hashes and two rows. On
this instance that is 57 pairs, and it is what an accountant reads as a
tenant paying twice.

**And it said same where the bank meant different.** The hash carried no
account. A booking of the same amount, on the same day, with the same purpose
on a SECOND account -- a transfer between two of the company's own accounts
is exactly that -- hashed identically to the first and was skipped. That one
does not show up as a duplicate; it shows up as a payment that is missing.

So: the account goes in, the two route-dependent fields come out, and what is
left is normalised before it is hashed.

WHAT MUST NOT HAPPEN when this changes, and the reason for legacy_forms():
a new hash for an old booking means the next fetch does not recognise it and
imports it again -- turning a fix for 57 duplicates into thousands. Every
booking is therefore looked up under the new hash AND under the old one,
and only written under the new.

No frappe import: this decides whether a payment is entered twice or not at
all, and it is exercised without a site.

def tidy(value):
    """Text as the bank meant it, not as its line width left it.

    Drops whitespace entirely and folds case. Nothing here is ever shown to
    anyone -- it goes straight into a hash -- so the only question is whether
    two spellings mean the same booking, and where the bank's line ended
    never does.

    This collapsed runs of whitespace into one space at first, and that was
    half a rule. It fixed "Datum 28.02.20 26" against "Datum 28.02.2026", but
    left "Fin keissen" different from "Finkeissen" -- and the fixed-width
    wrapping of MT940 produces exactly that, in the name as in the purpose.

    What settled it was the repair in verwendungszweck.py. The ``?20``-``?29``
    subfields of :86: were being glued without a separator, so every
    Rechnungsabschluss read "RechnungKosten SRZDauerrechnungsnummer.". Putting
    the separator back changes the purpose of every future booking -- and with
    a hash that counts spaces, not one of the bookings already in the database
    would have been recognised again. The next overlap day would have imported
    them all a second time. That is the wave this module exists to prevent,
    and it would have been caused by the fix for a display defect.

    So: where a line broke is not part of what the bank said. Two bookings
    that differ only in whitespace are one booking.
